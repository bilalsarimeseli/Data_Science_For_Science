Enhancing the margin distance serves to bolster the confidence in classifying future data points.\n",

        "Hyperplanes serve as decision boundaries facilitating the classification of data points. Data points situated on distinct sides of the hyperplane are assigned to different classes. Furthermore, the dimensionality of the hyperplane is contingent on the number of features. In cases where there are 2 input features, the hyperplane manifests as a line. With 3 input features, the hyperplane transforms into a two-dimensional plane. Visualization becomes challenging as the number of features surpasses 3.\n",

By leveraging these support vectors, we aim to maximize the margin of the classifier. The removal of support vectors can alter the hyperplane's position. These pivotal points play a crucial role in constructing our Support Vector Machine (SVM).\n",
